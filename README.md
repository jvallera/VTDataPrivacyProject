# Vermont Data Privacy Project
Objects and interventions that demistify data privacy and digital security. 

#### About 

I started this project in March 2018 as an artist in resident at Generator VT. 

This project explores methods that inform the public of the many risks online while educating them on how to best protect themselves through hands-on experiences. It is a mix of research and design. 

The project deliverables are evolving and include some version of the following:

* A pop-up data privacy workshop that is open to the public: An open space that breaks down barriers which prohibit people from thinking about these topics. 
* Mobile security assessment station: A free place to analyze and assess ditigal security effectiveness on wireless devices. 
* Local expertise: Stories and quotes from locals about their experiences with data privacy. 
* Printed materials: A variety of materials including posters, tapestries, books, etc. that communicate information about digital security best practices. 
* Culminating event: A one-day event for people to explore digital security tools and tactics.
